# WordPress.org SVN deploy script for easily publishing your WordPress plugins that primarily use the Git version control system.

# Deploy script came from here: https://github.com/thenbrent/multisite-user-management/blob/master/deploy.sh
# Which is a modification of Dean Clatworthy's deploy script as found here: https://github.com/deanc/wordpress-plugin-git-svn
# The difference is that this script lives in the plugin's git repo & doesn't require an existing SVN repo.

# This script needs to be executable (chmod +x wporg-deploy.sh)a
